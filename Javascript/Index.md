# This is a index page for javascript concepts.

1. prompt('msg') is used to ask for input.
2. In JS variable conversion is called coercion where :
  * String number = `Number(strNo)`
3. In JS `obj.a = obj["a"]` 
4. == is loose equals and === is strict equals
5. `null and undefined` are built in types in JS while `symbol` is a new type in ES6. one can use `typeof` operator to check/verify type.
* `typeof nuul` returns object which is sort of bug in JS.
